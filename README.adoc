Using `simple("${exchange.getMessage().getBody()}"` throws an exception at runtime when compiling natively:

.Exception at runtime
[source, bash]
----
...
Caused by: org.apache.camel.component.bean.MethodNotFoundException: Method with name: getMessage() not found on bean: Exchange[ED6D02F79FBB419-0000000000000000] of type: org.apache.camel.support.DefaultExchange on the exchange: Exchange[ED6D02F79FBB419-0000000000000000]
...
----

== Reproducer
* Build the project:
[source, bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----
* Observe that the tests succeed:
[source, bash]
----
...
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
...
----

* Build the application natively
[source, bash]
----
./mvnw --define native clean verify
----

* Observe that the tests fail with the above mentioned error in the application log, and an unexpected status code on the tests, reporting a status of `500` instead of the expected `200`:

...
Expected status code <200> but was <500>.

== Workaround
Add the following to `application.yml`:
[source, yaml]
----
quarkus:
  camel:
    native:
      reflection:
        include-patterns:
          - org.apache.camel.support.AbstractExchange
          - org.apache.camel.support.MessageSupport
----

(See branch `workaround`).

We we only register `AbstractExchange`, the call to `betBody()` in the `simple(...)` will generate the next exception.
